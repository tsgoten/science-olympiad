# Science Olympiad Cheat Sheet Template
## Overview
This is mainly for study events with limited pages. The particular example for this template is Water Quality, but will work for similar events. 

In my experience using a cheatsheet in landscape orientation with multiple columns with a really small font is the best way to take notes, but you are free to modify that in the template.

## Colors
xcolor package for the various subheadings and such, I created new commands for some of the colors for ease of use, example `\red{}`

You can also use commands like `\mysubsub` to access the various colors for the subheadings
